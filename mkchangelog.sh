lrev=$(git describe --tags --match 'mutt-*-rel' --abbrev=0)

# This is a rough approximation of the official ChangeLog format
# previously generated by hg.  Git doesn't provide enough formatting
# tools to produce this more accurately.  We could post-format it with
# a script, but I'm not sure enough people care about this file
# anymore to make it worth the effort.
